    <ol>
        <li>Separate 5 egg whites into a bowl then add a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Set that aside and sift 5 cups of almond flour with 1 1/2 cups of granulated sugar into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/3 of the almond flour mixture into the egg whites and fold it in gently with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Now go ahead and add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 2 tsps of almond extract. Then quickly fold it in.</li>
        <li>Add the second third of the almond flour mixture to the egg whites and gently fold it in again.</li>
        <li>Sift in the remaining third of the almond flour mixture and fold it in one last time. at this point, the cookie dough should have a thick paste like texture.</li>
        <li>Scoop out mounds of the cookie dough and place them into a plate of granulated sugar. Roll the scoop of cookie dough into the sugar, then take it into your hands and round it out to a ball.</li>
        <li>Drop the ball into a bowl of powdered sugar and evenly coat it.</li>
        <li>Place the cookies onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and lightly press each cookie with your hand. Bake at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for 20-25 minutes.</li>
